Today's goal:
1. ~~Add a gameover screen that allows (Restart the game, quit, go back to the main menu)~~
2. Add logic to trigger game over when the game is over
    - Logic to show the game over screen
    - Add functionality to the menu button
    - Add functionality to the restart button
3. Abstract and refactor the enemy movement and controller code (abstraction of methods, variables)
4. Add spawn and speed difficulty scaling that depends on the time elapsed (spawn more as time goes on, spawn faster as time goes on, move in closer to the player faster)
5. Introduce the second type of enemy - median difficulty (larger, moves slower, spawns slower)
